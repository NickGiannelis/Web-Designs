                <p>I have designed and implemented "Mouries," a web portfolio showcasing a traditional Greek taverna.
                    It highlights the authentic dishes and warm atmosphere of our establishment. This includes the creation of a menu
                    featuring classic Greek recipes such as moussaka and souvlaki, and the development of an inviting environment
                    through a carefully crafted gallery and navigation experience.</p>

                    like baklava and walnut cake, as well as contemporary recipes to satisfy every taste. Visit to enjoy freshly made

                <a href="https://www.perivola.com"><h2 style="color: blue;">Greek Grill House Website</h2></a>
                <p>This webpage is for Perivola, a traditional grill house that offers a unique gastronomic experience. 
                    I have also written the content for the shop's history and implemented an automation feature that allows 
                    customers to share content from social media (e.g., Facebook). When a new event is posted on Facebook, it is 
                    automatically added to the New Events page on the website, ensuring the latest events are always updated.
                    Perivola serves delicious skewers, souvlaki, and steaks made with fresh, high-quality ingredients. The aroma 
                    of perfectly grilled meat and the warm atmosphere guarantee a memorable dining experience. In addition to its 
                    exquisite cuisine, Perivola hosts live events, adding excitement and 
                    entertainment to every visit, making each one unforgettable.</p>
